<h1>About dsmtech</h1>
<p>
  When <a href="https://leerob.io">Lee Robinson</a> started looking for a new
  role in Des Moines, he made his own list of local tech companies and job
  boards. It quickly became clear there was no single, reliable index for the
  area.
</p>
<p>
  dsmtech began as a list of about 15 companies and has grown into a larger
  directory of public, private, and startup teams across Iowa. The goal is
  simple: help people discover great places to work without hunting across
  dozens of sites.
